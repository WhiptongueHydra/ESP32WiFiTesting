# ESP32WiFiTesting
This is just a repo to keep track of my messing around with esp-idf and wifi connections

Most of the stuff here is probably clunky and not best practice, but I dont really care I'm just feeling it out and learning about FreeRTOS/ esp-idf

Banned myself from AI code generation for this because it makes people lazy and write slop without understanding anything
